EXT. DOCUMENTATION - AFTERNOON, CLOUDY

AUDIENCE appears through a wrought-iron gate, looking around. NARRATOR's
muffled voice can be heard growing louder as AUDIENCE approaches center.
Inside is a menagerie of loud, exotic-looking birds and animals. NARRATOR
speaks louder to be heard over the din.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
            You've wandered into ScreenPy Selenium. It allows
            Actors to test web applications using Selenium.

                              AUDIENCE
                              (shouting)
            What?? I can barely hear you!! Speak up! Why are there
            so many??

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Selenium was the first extension for ScreenPy, so it is
            the most mature, and the largest.

                              AUDIENCE
                              (shouting, louder)
            I still can't hear you!! I'm going to find somewhere
            quieter!

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Lead the way...

                                                                      FADE OUT
